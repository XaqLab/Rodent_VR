libpython27.a is required to build caldev.exe for MS Windows. caldev.exe is a
bare bones Windows GUI that allows the user to move green dots around in the
projector image until there is a green dot in the center of each white light
spot from the 3D printed calibration device. caldev.exe then saves the
"centroid" (average x and average y for each pixel in the green spot) for each
green spot.
